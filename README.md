Location data logger for Nokia S60 phones with GPS

Date: 2010/2011

This is a Python script to run on a Nokia Symbian (S60) phone like the N95 or N82. <br>
It uses the GPS, camera, and audio - keeping a synced log file of the photo id, location, and head position in the audio file.
It's possible to use video too but the battery runs out quicker, so here we used audio.

The data was then downloaded and used in conjunction with environmetnal timestamped data (e.g. air quality data) so that 
the team had some idea of the context of the data captured (eg bus passing by could be attributed to a PM10 spike).
